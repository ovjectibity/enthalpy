# exponential ab testing with enthalpy | Î”H

Enthalpy is an agentic AI framework & tool designed to really accelarate AB testing for SaaS products (software of any kind really). The tool is surfaced as a webapp hosted over [enthalpy.cc](https://enthalpy.cc/), but the open source code can be self-hosted (even locally) & be used independently with any supported LLM provider.

## who is this for?

It would be a truism at this point to say that the software industry is changing rapidly, a state of affairs I truly consider to be a renaissance. And with this change, various established roles within the software industry are changing as we speak. With agentic AI, companies will increasingly hire for new roles & transition existing ones to super-ICPs responsible for end to end outcome-delivery for specific functional verticals.

This tool is specifically for such a future where growth / product / marketing teams within SaaS orgs will employ a few super-ICPs responsible for the end-to-end revenue outcomes with AB experimentation including designing, implementing & managing execution & rollout of experiments. Some of these responsibilities currently already lie within the charter of these roles. But others, especially UI/UX design, analytics & implementation may require collaboration with other specialised teams.

The tool is specifically for aiding end-to-enddesign (in the sense of idea/hypotheses generation, research, UI/UX design), implementation (in the sense code changes) & execution (in the sense of running, analysis, rollouts) of AB experiments aimed at whatever objectives an org musters up.

In short, the idea is to allow this super-ICP to be able to perform the whole cycle with minimal involvement with other teams or personnel & have all the tools to be able to do so.
