## Ways of working for implementation:
1. Please be conservative in the changes that you are doing. In most cases, I will be telling you exactly what I want you to do.
2. Usually, it is not a good idea to create new files, class, model, interface, type definitons. As much as possible, you should use existing ones. If you think one is really needed or recommended, check with me once before you proceed.
3. In case of any confusion, ambuiguity or inconsistencies in instructions, it's usually best to ask me rather than make assumptions & do something very adventurous.
