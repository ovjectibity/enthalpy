## Ways of working for implementation:
1. Please be conservative in the changes that you are doing. In most cases, I will be telling you exactly what I want you to do.
2. Usually, it is not a good idea to create new files, class, model, interface, type definitons unless I explicitly ask you to.
3. In case of any confusion, ambuiguity or inconsistencies in instructions, it's usually best to ask me rather than make assumptions & do something very adventurous.
